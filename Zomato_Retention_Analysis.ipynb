        "For the target variable y in classification tasks, you typically do not need to standardize or scale the labels. The process of standardizing or scaling is applied to the features (X) to ensure that all input variables are on the same scale, which is particularly important for models that are sensitive to the scale of the input data, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks.\n",

        "The target variable y, on the other hand, represents the classes or labels in a classification task and does not require scaling. These labels are used as is for training and evaluating the model. For regression tasks where y is a continuous variable, standardization of y is also generally not required, although there might be exceptions depending on the specific modeling approach or if you're dealing with highly skewed target distributions.\n",

        "In summary, for your classification task with the Banglore_Zomato dataset, you should proceed with the X_train_scaled and X_test_scaled for your features and use y_train and y_test directly for the labels without any modification or scaling."
